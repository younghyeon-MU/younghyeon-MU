### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Missouri - Columbia. 
My research focuses on agricultural economics and policy analysis. 
I am interested in studying the demand system and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and currently working on estimating demand elasticities of U.S. food commodities using a meta-analysis.
My hobby is doing Pilates, cooking, and baking.
